# The Philosophy of the Whitepaper 

Code before Words **=** Language Engineering

Note:
What is a WP? a structured document that explains a problem and a solution.
This isn’t a paper about computers; it’s a paper about words we already use, and how changing their meanings changes what we can do together.
Meanings of words I want to explore.
Thus Language Engineering

## What are we really talking about?

"How much bitcoin do you have?"

<span class="fragment">Not possession **but** participation</span>  
<span class="fragment">**Words** matter</span>  

<small>*Source: [@SwissHodler on X](https://x.com/SwissHodler/status/1975561828509077913)*  
*Twan Huys interview with Christine Lagarde, 2 October 2025 at De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam*</small>

Note: 
from a talk. most interesting, question from host.
very personal question. 
it represents a failure for them to price it.
participation in a rules based network.
this is not about the whitepaper, but an illustration of how words matter.
"What is the value of it?"
value is money amount
money amount is an expression of needs

## A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
**Peer** is a role
**Cash** is a state 
"Cold Hard Cash"

Note:
Bitcoin failure is tied to the literal assumption here
Peers are entities, could be people, could be businesses, could be groups, could be countries
Bitcoin doesn't care
Cash is a representation of finality, not an actual item.

## Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible
Trust is a **tax**


Note:
Why is this important?

## **Ongoing** Proof of Work

Not just the work, but the history of it

<span class="fragment" style="width:50%; float:right;" >![](/assets/images/claytablet.png)</span>


Note: The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of proof-of-work
it's not just proof in isolation
it's no coincidence that this isn't a powerpoint, github, see commits, see other work.
earliest writing is ledgers, records of transactions, spreadsheets basically.
Clay was hard to write but easy to read.
