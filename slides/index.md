# The Philosophy of the Whitepaper 



Note:
What is a WP? a structured document that explains a problem and a solution.
This isn’t a paper about computers; it’s a paper about words we already use, and how changing their meanings changes what we can do together.
Meanings of words I want to explore.

> "I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper."

Code before Words **=** Language Engineering

Notes: because it was written before, map not manifesto
Thus Language Engineering

## What are we really talking about?

"How much bitcoin do you have?"

<span class="fragment">Not possession **but** participation</span>  
<span class="fragment">**Words** matter</span>  

<small>*Source: [@SwissHodler on X](https://x.com/SwissHodler/status/1975561828509077913)*  
*Twan Huys interview with Christine Lagarde, 2 October 2025 at De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam*</small>

Note: 
from a talk. most interesting, question from host.
very personal question. 
it represents a failure for them to price it.
participation in a rules based network.
this is not about the whitepaper, but an illustration of how words matter.
"What is the value of it?"
value is money amount
money amount is an expression of needs

> A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

**Peer** is a role<br>
**Cash** is a state <br>
"Cold Hard Cash"

Note:
Bitcoins failure is tied to the literal assumption here.
Hence forks. (74 at forkdrop.io)

let's dissect.
Peers are entities, could be people, could be businesses, could be groups, could be countries
Bitcoin doesn't care
Cash is a representation of finality, not an actual item.

> Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible

Why is that important?
non-reversible important for non-reversible services 

Note:
"since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes"
large part of the abstract is about solution to the double spend problem
from the introduction
"While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."
Why is this important? or desirable?
how do you deal with guarantee - routine escrow

### Trust is a **tax**

## **Ongoing** Proof of Work

Not just the work, but the history of it

<span class="fragment" style="width:50%; float:right;" >![](/assets/images/claytablet.png)</span>


Note: The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of proof-of-work
it's not just proof in isolation
it's no coincidence that this isn't a powerpoint, github, see commits, see other work.
earliest writing is ledgers, records of transactions, spreadsheets basically.
Clay was hard to write but easy to read.
