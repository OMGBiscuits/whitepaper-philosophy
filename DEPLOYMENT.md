# Deployment Guide

This repository is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Initial GitHub Pages Setup

### 1. Push your code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add presentation files"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings → Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Click **Save**

### 3. Verify Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Build & Deploy Slides" workflow running
3. Once complete, your slides will be live at:
   ```
   https://talks.biscuits.lol
   ```

## How It Works

The workflow automatically builds and deploys your presentation on:
- **Pushes to `main` branch**
- **Manual workflow runs** (Actions tab → "Build & Deploy Slides" → "Run workflow")
- **When you create a release**

## Custom Domain Setup

### Step 1: Add Domain to GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings → Pages**
3. Enter your custom domain: `talks.biscuits.lol`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Create CNAME File

Create a `CNAME` file in your repository root:

```bash
echo "talks.biscuits.lol" > CNAME
git add CNAME
git commit -m "Add custom domain"
git push
```

### Step 3: Configure DNS

With your domain provider, configure DNS records:

**Option A: CNAME Record (recommended)**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: talks
Value: OMGBiscuits.github.io
```

**Option B: A Records**
```
Type: A
Name: talks
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: talks
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: talks
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: talks
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

### Step 4: Verify

After DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours), your custom domain should be accessible.

## PDF Distribution

The presentation PDF is automatically generated during the build process and distributed through multiple channels:

### Live Site Download
- PDF is generated by GitHub Actions and served from `talks.biscuits.lol/bitcoin-talk.pdf`
- Available immediately via the live presentation's download link
- Updated automatically on every push to main

### GitHub Releases
- When you create a release (e.g., `v1.0.0`), the PDF is automatically attached as a release asset
- Users can download versioned PDFs from the Releases page
- Perfect for archival and distribution

## Manual Deploy

You can manually trigger a deployment without pushing code:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab
2. Select "Build & Deploy Slides" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure `package.json` has all required dependencies
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Custom Domain Not Working

- Wait up to 24 hours for DNS propagation
- Verify DNS records with `dig` or `nslookup`
- Check that the CNAME file is in the repository root
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled in GitHub Pages settings
